				Privatization

		<p>Every since NASA has had its budget cut, it has begun to leave the picture. China is a little too late to the party (they first got a man into space
		in 2003), and the European Space Agency, well, European governments have more to worry about than space. In fact, that’s something that almost every 
		government on the planet suffers from: they have too much on their plate. With that in mind, private companies have begun to take center stage. 
		SpaceX, created and headed by Elon Musk, has good odds, seeing as they’ve been doing missions for NASA and other companies since October 2008. The Mars 
		One team has extensive plans to use established aerospace companies (like SpaceX) to create and develop the necessary technologies for a martian 
		habitat. Another contender is this department is The Mars Society, who already has a simulated Mars habitat set up in the Utah desert. It remains to 
		be seen which one of these companies will make it to the red planet first.</p>

		<p>Founded in 2002 and led by Elon Musk, the 21st richest man on the planet, SpaceX made headlines when it spearheaded the attempt by NASA to privatize
		the space industry when its Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on October 8th, 2012, the first supply run by a private company in 
		the history of NASA. Since then, they’ve completed another 10 for NASA and 17 for other companies and non-American government agencies, creating the 
		longest list of launches of any space company currently in existence. When it comes to Mars, they’ve made clear their goal to get there, creating a design 
		for an Interplanetary Transport System, along with designing a rocket that allows for recovery of its boosters, essential when it comes to the limited 
		supplies of a Mars mission. In addition, there Mars Colonial Transporter is due out by the end of the year, and Musk has mentioned that they have a space 
		suit in the works as well. With a drive to make it their, and the funds, to boot, they’re widely considered to be the top prospect in this growing industry.</p>

		<p>Mars One, while relatively new on the scene (est. 2011) already has a projected launch date for its first unmanned rover (2026) and for its first 
		launch of a human crew to Mars (2031). Their timeline includes the launch of a satellite in 2024, the launch of cargo missions and set-up in 2029 and 
		2030, respectively, and the next giant leap for mankind in 2032. In fact, there hope is for a human crew to begin training full-time by 2017 and 
		continue until 2031, when they will launch for the red planet, allowing the crew to get used to the long period of isolation that they will endure 
		while on their mission. So far, they have plans for the departure of a total of 3 crews, though they have made it clear that if they do succeed, new 
		crews will begin to launch every 26 months. When it comes to astronaut safety, every time a crew is launched, the supplies and habitats for the next 
		crew will be launched a few months later, giving a high level of redundancy in case of machine failure or other unforeseen circumstances. Of all the 
		companies with a clear blueprint for Martian colonization, this group definitely takes 1st place.</p>

		<p>The Mars Society, created in August of 1998, is an organization dedicated to the colonization of the red planet. Unlike other teams and research 
		groups vying for the opportunity to put a human on Mars, they actually have a plan on bringing the astronauts back to Earth. To accomplish this, they’ve 
		set up a hypothetical system in which the explorers utilize the martian surface to develop the fuel needed for the return trip, and exploit the orbits of 
		the two planets to vastly reduce the time and energy needed for a return trip by a scale of six. Another factor on their side, they’ve already got a test 
		site, set up in the south of Utah, and have plans for a 1-year simulated mission in the Canadian high arctic, christened the “Mars Arctic 365 Mission”. 
		As their president Robert Zubrin pointed out during a press conference: <em>“We are much closer today to being able to send humans to Mars than we were to 
		being able to send men to the Moon in 1961, and we were there eight years later. Given the will, we could have humans on Mars within a decade.”</em></p>

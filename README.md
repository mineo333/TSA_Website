# TSA Website
The website for TSA.
We will research first, so do not make any changes to these files yet.  (Except for basic style and html changes)

IMPORTANT: DO NOT MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY TO MASTER. If you are working on anything, branch master and commit to that instead.
If you are just adding a few lines that will not need any debugging, you can commit to master.

View the site at: https://mission-to-mars.000webhostapp.com/ This is not updated unless I do it manually, so if you want to see your changes with the PHP, ask me.

Before you do anything, make sure you are familiar with how GitHub works. Here's a good place to start: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
